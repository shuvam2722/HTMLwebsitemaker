## Packages

### 1. [**Builder**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/writy/tree/main/packages/builder): Next.js application

This application is the primary user-facing application. Once it’s up and running (see [Installation](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/writy#installation) section), it’s available on http://localhost:3002/.

### 2. [**Sections**](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/writy/tree/main/packages/sections): TailwindCSS components

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is an open source engine that connects to our databases & micro-services and auto-generates a production-ready GraphQL backend. It’s very easy to get Hasura up and running on our local system. All the migrations are set up in the [migrations](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nextjs-hasura-trello-clone/tree/master/packages/backend/migrations) directory.

## Installation

### 1. **Clone the application**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shuvam2722/HTMLwebsitemaker
```

### 2. **Change directory**

```sh
cd writy
```

### 3. **Install necessary dependencies for the frontend application**

```sh
yarn bootstrap
```

### 4. **Start the packages**

From the root directory, we can run the following command to start both our packages:
